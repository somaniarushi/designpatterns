# Design Patterns 

My notes and example code for the book Design Patterns by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Richard Helm, and Ralph Johnson.

## What is a Design Pattern?
Any design pattern is a trend in object programming that crops up enough times to warrant its own classification. Recognizing these patterns makes code writing faster, and allows use of more flexible and reusable code.

## Why Use Object Oriented?
Because objects are encapsulated. To change an object's internal data, we have to perform an operation. To perform an operation, we have to receive a message (request) from a client. The abstraction helps ensure interaction without messy data manipulation.

It's also because THIS is what I'm trying to tackle:
